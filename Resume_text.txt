Experience
Graduate Student Researcher

BioNLP Lab @ UMass Amherst — Guide: Prof. Hong Yu
Amherst, USA | August 2025 – Present

Designed an ontology-driven self-play framework where dual LLM agents (Q&A) co-evolve to fill biomedical knowledge gaps leveraging ontology data, achieving 12% performance boost over Supervised Fine Tuning.

Implemented post-training alignment techniques like DPO, evidence-aligned RL and enhanced factuality by 8%.

Advanced Data Science Associate

ZS Associates — Pune, India
November 2024 – July 2025

Developed and deployed a Switch Prediction Model to predict patients switching from ongoing drug treatments using real-world data and ML/DL models (Bayesian classifier, XGBoost, ANN, TabNet).

Delivered 70% precision @ 60% recall; created visualizations, communicated results and SHAP analysis to clients, aiding in optimizing marketing efforts with projected cost savings of up to $500K.

Built patient cohorts using SQL and performed patient archetyping via clustering.

Engineered a dashboard to visualize model results and automate retraining and inference, enabling one-click MLOps.

AI/ML Engineer

Decimal Point Analytics — Mumbai, India
July 2023 – October 2024

Designed a predictive maintenance pipeline to forecast defects in industrial machinery using time-series models.

Mentored two interns on a Knowledge Distillation and Few-shot Object Detection project.

Built a RAG system for Q&A over PDFs/Excel files using Pinecone, integrating knowledge graphs to get a 9% accuracy boost; used multi-threading to reduce latency by 75%.

Created an agent-based hybrid web scraper by finetuning Llama2 (7B/13B) via LoRA for text extraction and using GPT-4 for code generation, reducing downtime from 12 hours to 3 minutes.

Developed a DALLE-3 pipeline to generate fabric design patterns from textual specifications.

Prototyped multiple GenAI products using open/closed LLMs, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Django.

AI Research Intern — Co-op Program

Raapid AI x IIT Jodhpur — Remote, India
Sept 2022 – May 2023

Engineered a table detection pipeline by finetuning CascadeTabNet and DIT, achieving 76% mAP.

Applied novel augmentation strategies, improving mAP by 7% on a private gold-standard dataset.

AI/ML Intern

Decimal Point Analytics — Remote, India
May 2022 – July 2022

Built an end-to-end accident detection and damage segmentation pipeline for CCTV footage.

Conducted experiments with Vision Transformer, YOLO, and other architectures, securing an F1 score of 87%.
